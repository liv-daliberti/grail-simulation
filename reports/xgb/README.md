# XGBoost Report Catalog

Slate-ranking and opinion-regression baselines trained with XGBoost.
Feature spaces include TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Sentence-Transformer representations.

These summaries are regenerated by `python -m xgb.pipeline` (or the training wrappers).
Each report captures the current XGBoost baseline performance at a glance.

- `hyperparameter_tuning/README.md` — sweep leaderboards and the per-study winners.
- `next_video/README.md` — validation accuracy, confidence intervals, baseline deltas, and training versus validation accuracy curves for the production slate task.
- `opinion/README.md` — post-study opinion regression metrics, plus heatmaps under `reports/xgb/opinion/`.

All referenced Markdown artifacts live under `models/xgb/next_video` or `models/xgb/opinions`. Re-running the pipeline refreshes them with new metrics.

## Refreshing Reports

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m xgb.pipeline --stage full \
  --out-dir models/xgb \
  --reports-dir reports/xgb
```

Stages can be invoked individually (`plan`, `sweeps`, `finalize`, `reports`) to match existing SLURM workflows.

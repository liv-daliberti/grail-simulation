# KNN Report Catalog

Baseline: k-nearest neighbours slate-ranking and opinion-regression models built on TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Sentence-Transformer feature spaces.

These summaries are regenerated by `python -m knn.pipeline` (or the training wrappers) and provide a quick overview of the latest KNN baseline performance.

- `hyperparameter_tuning/README.md` — sweep leaderboards and the per-study configuration that won each feature space.
- `next_video/README.md` — validation accuracy, confidence intervals, baseline deltas, and training vs. validation accuracy curves for the production slate task.
- `opinion/README.md` — post-study opinion regression metrics alongside heatmaps generated under `reports/knn/opinion/`.

All artefacts referenced in the Markdown live under `models/knn/…`. Running the pipeline again will overwrite these reports with fresh numbers.

## Refreshing Reports

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m knn.pipeline --stage full \
  --out-dir models/knn \
  --reports-dir reports/knn
```

Use `--stage plan` to inspect the sweep grid, `--stage sweeps` for array execution, and `--stage reports` to rebuild the documentation from existing metrics.

The chosen video supports the idea that paying employees a wage to live well boosts overall market. PragerU ventures deeper into the context of the proposed policy results. Given the issue derived from the video and our objectives, choosing either PragerU or an informative video on the topic is reasonable candidates. Option 4\u2019s video, focused on the idea of raising the minimum wage, seems relevant for showing support further for raising minimum wage. This aligns very well with discussing the cost of a higher minimum wage. Also, difference of intent between wage policy and heavy profit business stance or price. Option 1 might not align as closely with improving our current video\u2019s context or detail being created.

# KNN Report Catalog

Baseline: KNN slate-ranking and opinion-regression models.
Feature spaces include TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Sentence-Transformer representations.

These summaries are regenerated by `python -m knn.pipeline` (or the training wrappers).
Each report captures the latest KNN baseline performance at a glance.

- `additional_features/README.md` — overview of the extra text fields appended to prompts.

- `hyperparameter_tuning/README.md` — sweep leaderboards and the per-study winners.
- `next_video/README.md` — validation accuracy, confidence intervals, baseline deltas, and training versus validation accuracy curves for the production slate task.
- `opinion/README.md` — post-study opinion regression metrics, plus heatmaps under `reports/knn/opinion/`.

All referenced Markdown artifacts live under `models/knn/next_video` or `models/knn/opinions`. Re-running the pipeline refreshes them with new metrics.

## Refreshing Reports

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m knn.pipeline --stage full \
  --out-dir models/knn \
  --reports-dir reports/knn
```

Use `--stage plan` to inspect the sweep grid and `--stage sweeps` for array execution.
Run `--stage reports` to rebuild documentation from existing metrics.

"""Top-level orchestration helpers for the ``clean_data`` package.

This module stitches together the key pieces of the cleaning pipeline:
loading raw CodeOcean or Hugging Face datasets, filtering unusable rows,
converting interactions into prompt-ready examples, validating schema
requirements, saving artifacts, and dispatching prompt statistics reports.
It is the public surface that downstream tooling should import when they
need to build or persist cleaned prompt datasets. All functionality here is
distributed under the repository's Apache 2.0 license; see LICENSE for
details.

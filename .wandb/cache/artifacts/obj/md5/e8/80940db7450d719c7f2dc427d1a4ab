The issue is about whether the minimum wage in Seattle is working, and she watches the Seattle's $15 Minimum Wage Experiment video. Given that she watches YouTube videos, it's possible to argue that the best approach might be a societal approach such as a minimum wage policy developed by government intervention. Thus, option 1 might be closer to what the viewer would like to see since it's about setting the minimum wage by supply and demand consistency. Option 3 is probably motivated to raise the minimum wage profile prudently, while option 2 is more instructional. Both 2 and 3 ward intellectual property problems, while only option 1 engages politics. Considerable consensus exists that neither option 2 nor 3 solve economic issues involving out-of-age and budget constrained, urban centers that embrace liberal policies and a large lull of resource.

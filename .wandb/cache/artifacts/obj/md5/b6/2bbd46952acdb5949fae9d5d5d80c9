Therefore, options 3 and 1 stand out as more directly relevant since either choice is not likely to be indicated as being unpopular or associated with conservative positions claiming to support an $18-25 minimum wage these days. Option 3 seems preferable given context and my chief criteria for practice content that allows me range higher than the average $7.75 level provided in other content. Plus, for typical posts like this one, seeing someone adding support rather than questioning mainstream support options is more impactful than mentioning retail investors, which is less likely to be the context we're working with here.

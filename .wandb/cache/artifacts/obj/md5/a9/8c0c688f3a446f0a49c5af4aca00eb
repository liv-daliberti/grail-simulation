Fox News's submission seems to be about the policy debate and its reasoning based on 25-30 million people polled for the Democratic presidential candidates' resume in the CBO analysis. The CBO acknowledges their methodology is subjective, and the Democratic candidates' behalf received more weight as the issue. Black Lives Matter activists appear to be the primary group opposing the wage hike. Erica Manchin, the Ohio senator, supports the $15 minimum wage, but the latest potential move is not exactly a clear-legitimize response to the concerns. And Foley's recent opinion, though controversial, aligns with conservative values.\nSeveral other popular and valid options exist, such as Manchin's argument: she argues the rising cost of living and human rights to be the real issues. Not mentioned so far but considered to be an item of the democratic candidates' main opponents, Manconova also opposes to go against the Democratic candidates' support to implement feasible and non-violent policies like a $15 minimum wage.

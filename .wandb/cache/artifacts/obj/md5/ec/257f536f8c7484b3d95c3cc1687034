Popeye's CEO on $15 minimum wage \u2014 channel: Fox Business<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nThe rsession appears to focus on the impact of $15 minimum wage on the job market. ReasonTV mentions the increase in the CBO\u2019s projected job loss in 5 years. Bloomberg provides links that suggest potential job losses in line with what ReasonTV discusses. The Hill is related to making $15 minimum wage undebunked and Gray's quick take on the topic. The Fox Business is related to Popeye suggested decreases in Gary. However, Fox Business\u2019s topic linking to Popeye decreases in wage doesn't align well with the specific context on CBO\u2019s projected loss. Given the importance of the CBO warning, ReasonTV seems the best fit as ReasonTV is focused on the effects of raised wages, and CBO does predict a loss due to the wage hike.\n\n  \nAdditionally, Reason shows the point from Reason TV more directly. This combines information more closely and aligns with the video mentioned earlier.

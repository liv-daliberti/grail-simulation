"""Reference mapping between Qualtrics question IDs and friendly feature names.

This table helps us keep track of where each prompt feature originates in the
CodeOcean survey exports. The ``question_ids`` list contains the raw column
names observed across the intermediate CSVs for Studies 1â€“4. When the builder
renames or aggregates features, refer back here to understand which Qualtrics
items are involved. The mapping is provided under the repository's Apache 2.0
license; see LICENSE for the complete text.

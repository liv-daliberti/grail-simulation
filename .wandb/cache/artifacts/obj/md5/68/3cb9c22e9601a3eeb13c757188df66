Notably, the last video mentioned why increasing the minimum wage wouldn't raise inflation (Option 4), aligning with the user's focus. Therefore, the most relevant and overarching option is Option 4 about raising the minimum wage, which says \"Not only won't raising minimum wage cause inflation, but increasing the wage would actually stymie it\" (cause/effect of not causing inflation), which stands in juxtaposition with the consumer notion.\n\n<think> \nIn the previous video on blog, the writer seems to be connecting the raising of employment to inflation.

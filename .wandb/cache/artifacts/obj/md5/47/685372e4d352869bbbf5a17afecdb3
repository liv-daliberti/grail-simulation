PragerU has no direct link to the issue, but she must be informed through these podcasts. The top 3 views are similar to Rose\u2019s choices: TV outlets or academic venues. PragerU is also prominent in the initial context, as it addresses the topic directly and uses data to support its views (1), applying an academic criterion currently absent from independent media.

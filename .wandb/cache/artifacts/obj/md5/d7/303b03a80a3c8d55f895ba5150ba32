He is known for his views on freedom of the market and the necessity for it to self-regulate, as opposed to government intervention. Therefore, it's reasonable to deduce that Milton Friedman's perspective on the topic might align with the topic of a minimum wage model, especially when considering that minimization and excess dynamic point towards a Walrasian-type economic model with bi-directional, independent money production along with self-governing markets and minimal executive reminders. In a wider perspective, his economic framework is akin to libertarian stances, which might resonate similarly. Panama appears as unlikely, belonging to the \"businessless part of economic evolution animals.\" This opinion leans against the bulk of potential information, theories, or mainstream econ studies from the 21st century.

Since political lean alone influences the choice of PTT (progressive toward the issue), a Bush Edgeworth figure like Briahna would likely be part of a persuade group's strategy. His support on the minimum wage should increase before this is voted on. This indicates that Carlos would likely vote for others defining the minimum wage, especially since the focus here is on Republicans supposingly against if including a wage increase alone will result in job losses of 1.4 million by 2025.

Amazon's new minimum wage is relevant as an industry standard to compare to a minimum wage experiment, while MSNBC on MSNBC is a reputable news source. The first option (Vox \"What the US gets wrong about minimum wage\") directly addresses minimum wage, as evidence-based for contrary claims.

One of the options, \"A $15 minimum wage would hurt those it's meant to help,\" would likely align with his liberal ideology and support for higher wages.\nAdditionally, the minimum wage debate is notably underlined by the content creator Milton Friedman, which suggests it's a staunch position for him. His support index is down to 0.93, a slightly more moderate stance than the Wall Street Journal; however, with Milton Friedman's long-standing arguments, the commentator would fit well with the profile.\nLastly, this doesn't seem to align well with his explanation for dumbing down a child that shows why he supports it differently since he's supportive of higher wages, and having them understand dedication could have helped reduce his extreme stance. He might need to decrease the support for their wage characteristics since he already emphasizes low wages, thereby aligning with Walter E Williams.\n</think>\n<answer>\n1\n</answer>", 0.0, -0.4999000132083893], ["213", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are choosing EXACTLY ONE item from a short slate for a specific viewer.\n\nInput you will see:\n  \u2022 Viewer profile and optional context/history\n  \u2022 An \"OPTIONS:\" list with items numbered 1..N\n    \u2013 Each item is shown as either a title (preferred) or an id\n\nYour job:\n  \u2022 Think briefly in <think>\u2026</think> using the viewer\u2019s profile, context, and options.\n  \u2022 Compare the top 2\u20133 candidates, then choose the single best option.\n  \u2022 Never invent new items; choose only from the given OPTIONS list.\n\nOutput format (STRICT):\n  \u2022 First output your hidden reasoning in <think>\u2026</think>.\n    \u2013 In your thinking, reference candidates by their numbers and names (or ids) to justify the choice.\n  \u2022 Then output ONLY the chosen option\u2019s NUMBER inside <answer>\u2026</answer>.\n    \u2013 Do NOT output the name, id, or any extra text\u2014ONLY the number.\n    \u2013 Do NOT include punctuation, quotes, or a period after the number.\n\nExamples of valid <answer>:\n  <answer>\n  3\n  </answer>\n\nExamples of INVALID <answer> (never do these):\n  <answer>3.</answer>                 \u2190 trailing period\n  <answer>\"3\"</answer>                \u2190 quoted\n  <answer>Option 3</answer>           \u2190 extra words\n  <answer>Parkland \u2026</answer>         \u2190 name instead of number\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nPROFILE:\n(no profile provided)\n\nSESSION CONTEXT:\n- Issue: minimum_wage\n- Issue detail: derived from video 2voNlYS-8C0\n- Issue source: tree_metadata\n- Session ID: VIaXY1c9TEvIkZGlFwsK\n- Step: 4\n- Slate source: session_log\n- Options in slate: 4\n\nCURRENT VIDEO:\nBiden's minimum wage hike will kill 1.4M jobs: CBO \u2014 channel: Fox News\n\nHISTORY (most recent first):\n1.

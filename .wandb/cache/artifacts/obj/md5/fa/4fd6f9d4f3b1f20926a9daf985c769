Given the options and their contexts, many viewers might find the topic supportive of conservatives like Thom Hartmann. Options 3 and 4 are in this vein, especially view 3, which threatens employment directly.\n\nHowever, a more general stance option might resonate better with broader viewership. Considering 4 includes specific content about insurance agents' reactions to $15 minimum wage, it might be a good starting point to discuss points of view beyond just individual conservatives. \n\nTherefore, if we follow hints from the original issue (minimum wage consequences, cruelty of the $15 minimum wage), option 4 is best thought of as a stoplight element: It signals a more factual comparison that fits within the conservative mindset and provides useful, much-forgiven context. \n\n<answer>\n1\n</answer>", 1.0, 0.4999000132083893], ["179", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are choosing EXACTLY ONE item from a short slate for a specific viewer.\n\nInput you will see:\n  \u2022 Viewer profile and optional context/history\n  \u2022 An \"OPTIONS:\" list with items numbered 1..N\n    \u2013 Each item is shown as either a title (preferred) or an id\n\nYour job:\n  \u2022 Think briefly in <think>\u2026</think> using the viewer\u2019s profile, context, and options.\n  \u2022 Compare the top 2\u20133 candidates, then choose the single best option.\n  \u2022 Never invent new items; choose only from the given OPTIONS list.\n\nOutput format (STRICT):\n  \u2022 First output your hidden reasoning in <think>\u2026</think>.\n    \u2013 In your thinking, reference candidates by their numbers and names (or ids) to justify the choice.\n  \u2022 Then output ONLY the chosen option\u2019s NUMBER inside <answer>\u2026</answer>.\n    \u2013 Do NOT output the name, id, or any extra text\u2014ONLY the number.\n    \u2013 Do NOT include punctuation, quotes, or a period after the number.\n\nExamples of valid <answer>:\n  <answer>\n  3\n  </answer>\n\nExamples of INVALID <answer> (never do these):\n  <answer>3.</answer>                 \u2190 trailing period\n  <answer>\"3\"</answer>                \u2190 quoted\n  <answer>Option 3</answer>           \u2190 extra words\n  <answer>Parkland \u2026</answer>         \u2190 name instead of number\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nPROFILE:\n(no profile provided)\n\nSESSION CONTEXT:\n- Issue: minimum_wage\n- Issue detail: derived from video rQj1qlsjVoM\n- Issue source: tree_metadata\n- Session ID: vkU9t1hPwyNXbmGCNvNV\n- Step: 4\n- Slate source: session_log\n- Options in slate: 4\n\nCURRENT VIDEO:\nWho Does a $15 Minimum Wage Help? \u2014 channel: PragerU\n\nHISTORY (most recent first):\n1.

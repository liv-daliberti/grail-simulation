Option 3 addresses minimum wage increases in a more egotistical tone (\"Joe Rogan\"), and option 1 uses the name of a celebrity, which might resonate with voters. Ben Shapiro is moderate and left-leaning, but he may not make the best candidate for the persona of someone who cares about minimum wage issues.

Her preferred right-leaning news sources and her YouTube habits suggest she's likely to favor issues aligned with the Republican Party. The minimum wage is an ongoing issue.\nPresumably, she's some kind of moderate Republican or even a little more in the middle. She likely dislikes inflation and economic uncertainty, and she probably believes small business owners get a grip from minimum wage increase.\nCounter Arguments appears to be backed by \"Richard Eskildsen\" and supported by Minneapolis Fed, so it has potential. However, it does not necessarily fit her middle-of-the-road leanings. For this, she might not be unduly influenced.\nAmagilly and Thom Hartmann are decidedly liberal. They have the potential to sway for her liberal leanings, but she likely won't just go with amagilly at this point, so they're less perfect.\nElevated minimum wage amounts for the Federal Reserve are distasteful for her overall view.

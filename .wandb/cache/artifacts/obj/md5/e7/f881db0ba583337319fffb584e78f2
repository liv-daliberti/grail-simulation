The Oakley Air is the go-to for managing extra-elastic air in lower-top areas which usually when there's a Icegrip blend, or when there's an air release on top. The Oakley Air has cusps that allow for autonomious sliding, and a second membrane that houses outer layer Taping Compound to control sanding.

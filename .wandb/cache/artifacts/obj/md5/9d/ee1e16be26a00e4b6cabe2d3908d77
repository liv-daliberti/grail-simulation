The viewer has a college degree, is moderately interested in politics, and is interested in the topic of minimum wage. My top choice would be one that seems relevant and holds strong arguments Typically I pick topics or speakers with strong views and coverage, focusing on their argument or opinion on the point. This means that the session probably values the opinion or history of minimum wage increasingly.\n\nMaking a decision based on political arguments straight, option 5 seems reputable per history and seems like the best fit. These viewers would probably turn in favor of the minimum wage due the involvement of a month of study in the session as well as Fox Business.

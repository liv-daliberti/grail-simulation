The most similar option from the slate to the most relevant context is A $15 minimum wage would hurt those it's meant to help \u2014 channel: Learn Liberty, as it seems to be addressing the ethical and economic question from a similar standpoint.\n\nMore explanation: A $15 minimum wage policy affects the farming health insurance industry's profits.

He is interested in the minimum wage but leaning slightly away from strong support for increased it. Given his recent history, support for a 20% minimum wage, this video is unlikely to support the argument for higher minimum wages.\nUploaders are multilingual, smartphones are in most of the target countries, so he is equally likely to consume content in French or Korean.\nINCONCLUSIVE: Option 3 is triple weighted against Option 1. OPTION 3 is Third Peoples\u2019 documentary studio, trending highly positive. It adopts progressive Democratic ideas, so it can eliminate the minimum wage discussion. Option 4 is MSNBC\u2019s coverage but moderate support. Option 3 is officially mentioning progressive ideas.

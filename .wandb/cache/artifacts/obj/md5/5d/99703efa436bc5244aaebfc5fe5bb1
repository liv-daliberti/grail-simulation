Additionally, even without social welfare impacts, Option 4 might potentially inform Biden much more economically than the country as a whole in general being discussed. </think>\n\n<answer>1</answer>", 1.0, 0.4999000132083893], ["203", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are choosing EXACTLY ONE item from a short slate for a specific viewer.\n\nInput you will see:\n  \u2022 Viewer profile and optional context/history\n  \u2022 An \"OPTIONS:\" list with items numbered 1..N\n    \u2013 Each item is shown as either a title (preferred) or an id\n\nYour job:\n  \u2022 Think briefly in <think>\u2026</think> using the viewer\u2019s profile, context, and options.\n  \u2022 Compare the top 2\u20133 candidates, then choose the single best option.\n  \u2022 Never invent new items; choose only from the given OPTIONS list.\n\nOutput format (STRICT):\n  \u2022 First output your hidden reasoning in <think>\u2026</think>.\n    \u2013 In your thinking, reference candidates by their numbers and names (or ids) to justify the choice.\n  \u2022 Then output ONLY the chosen option\u2019s NUMBER inside <answer>\u2026</answer>.\n    \u2013 Do NOT output the name, id, or any extra text\u2014ONLY the number.\n    \u2013 Do NOT include punctuation, quotes, or a period after the number.\n\nExamples of valid <answer>:\n  <answer>\n  3\n  </answer>\n\nExamples of INVALID <answer> (never do these):\n  <answer>3.</answer>                 \u2190 trailing period\n  <answer>\"3\"</answer>                \u2190 quoted\n  <answer>Option 3</answer>           \u2190 extra words\n  <answer>Parkland \u2026</answer>         \u2190 name instead of number\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nPROFILE:\n36-year-old, man, Caucasian/White (non-Hispanic), independent liberal, $40,000-$49,999, watches YouTube several times a week\n\nDEMOGRAPHICS:\n- Age: 36\n- Gender: Man\n- Race/ethnicity: Caucasian/White (non-Hispanic)\n- College: not college educated\n- Household income: $40,000-$49,999\n\nPOLITICS:\n- Party identification: Independent\n- Ideology: Liberal\n- Political interest: 3\n\nMINIMUM WAGE:\n- Minimum wage stance (wave 1, inferred): 0.28\n- Minimum wage stance (wave 2, inferred): 0.2\n- Minimum wage stance (wave 1, survey): 18\n- Minimum wage stance (wave 2, survey): 20\n- Minimum wage support index (wave 1): 0.11833333333333333\n- Minimum wage support index (wave 2): 0.06666666666666667\n- $15 minimum wage support (wave 1): no\n- $15 minimum wage support (wave 2): no\n- Supports wage increase (wave 1): no\n- Supports wage increase (wave 2): no\n- Minimum wage howhigh w1: 0\n- Minimum wage howhigh w2: 0\n- Minimum wage help w1: 0.2222222222222222\n- Minimum wage help w2: 0\n- Minimum wage restrict w1: 0.4444444444444444\n- Minimum wage restrict w2: 0.3333333333333333\n\nMEDIA HABITS:\n- YouTube frequency: several times a week\n\nSESSION CONTEXT:\n- Issue: minimum_wage\n- Issue detail: derived from video rQj1qlsjVoM\n- Issue source: tree_metadata\n- Session ID: MRne2rnckNEENsdhafEW\n- Step: 3\n- Slate source: session_log\n- Options in slate: 4\n\nCURRENT VIDEO:\nA $15 minimum wage would hurt those it's meant to help \u2014 channel: Learn Liberty\n\nHISTORY (most recent first):\n1.

Option 4 addresses the argument that $7.25 is\u00a0not enough, which is also relevant. Option 1 relates to Senator Joe Manchin's stance on the minimum wage, which is likely from the panel that interprets the claims and finds it opposed to the minimum wage. Options 2 and 3 provide the views of opponents of a $15 hourly wage, specifically around whether it would hurt jobs. Because the viewer seems to be conservative and interested in the minimum wage, Option 1 seems the best. It speaks to Sen.

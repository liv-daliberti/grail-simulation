Gutfeld seems in conflict with the show's intent, so it is likely of not much influence. The viewer is likely to bypass on a YouTube format than to engage with narrow advocacy material. The starting channel (4) is value-neutral, so it won't appeal much. Moreover, you need the best of the source channels, inclusive of latest views. After investigation, the viewership tends to gravitate the issue back towards Biden and then outweighs Bernstein.

Sachin Thummim speaks multiple times throughout a video, and it is common in a video to speak multiple times. Therefore, a call from 'america call me' does not align well with talking multiple times. Also, it's quite familiar and common to mention Scathin Thummim's connection to the minimum-wage issue. Such calls to name drop a person rather than providing balanced, pertinent information to the issue. Hence, both [1] and [2] can be ruled out due to the lack of value provided focused on the raising cost of labor. The remaining options reviewed should cover a broader and more key-sensitive depiction of direct impacts and policy views.

Since the slate shows \"OPTIONS,\" my next step is to choose the most neutral-looking option that doesn't align specifically with either militant position implied in the history, but instead presents a clearer headway towards a resolution or cognitive exploration rather than advocacy or opposition. The audience on the session is looking at economic data and statistics, making \"Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour\" in the context of job hurts or job creation appeal to the phone statistic actors, so these aren't ideal options. Conversely, \"Study: Minimum Wage Hikes INCREASE Jobs\" aligns with the statistic actors and makes further reasoning possible.

Milton Friedman's perspective on the minimum wage is likely more relevant than the others. Between Milton Friedman and Charles Koch, the latter seems less researched and positioned for likely high discussions. Row 3, Someone Give Him a Raise, seems irrelevant. The non-correlation between minimum wage increases and job growth means that specific podcasts cannot be ruled out, but their emphasis might be similar as well. But, finding a reframed perspective on the topic like Milton Friedman's is more likely to resonate. A clearer stance on either the educational or economic policy impact of a wider income distribution helps cement subject expertise.

The specific channel's point is about increasing one aspect of labor laws while leaving the main feature of increased wages for workers unchanged.

However, the most pertinent area is increasing the wage to improve overall economy or benefits. Looking at those viewpoints, I find the choice: \"Bar Rescue host Jon Taffer: Minimum wage hikes hurt restaurants\" as it seems Mr. Taffer is an expert reader and could engage with the subject better, even though it focuses on a different issue. Among the options, the one that directly addresses the question not only the minimum wage issue but also stresses the effects on restaurants is viewed to be significant by me.

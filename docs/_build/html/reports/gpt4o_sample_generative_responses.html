The viewer is a Republican conservative who is somewhat interested in politics and enthusiastic about guns, with a low gun regulation support score. Given her profile, she might prefer content that aligns with her conservative views and enthusiasm for guns. Option 2, &quot;GUN CONTROL: WHY YOU CAN&#39;T COMPARE AUSTRALIA AND THE U.S&quot; by Sydney Watson, seems to cater to a conservative audience and has high engagement, which suggests it resonates well with viewers. Option 4, &quot;Scotland Gun Control: Where Nightmares Are Reality&quot; by Colion Noir, also has high engagement and might appeal to her enthusiasm for guns. Option 1, &quot;Most Americans Want More Gun Control. Why Doesn’t It Happen?&quot; from NYT, might not align with her views as it suggests a pro-gun control stance. Between options 2 and 4, option 2 seems more relevant as it discusses the comparison between countries, which might interest her given her political interest.

<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;think&gt;
The viewer is a conservative Republican who is somewhat interested in politics and not very concerned about gun policy. She has shown a pattern of not completing videos that are critical of gun ownership or advocate for gun control, as seen in her recent viewing history. Given her political alignment and interest in guns, she might prefer content that aligns with her views or presents a balanced perspective rather than one that is overtly critical of gun ownership.

Option 1, &quot;The Truth About Guns And Gun Control | Debunker | NBC News,&quot; might provide a balanced or debunking perspective, which could be appealing. However, NBC News might not align with her conservative views.

Option 2, &quot;Gun control and the statistics behind America&#39;s love affair with guns | The Economist,&quot; might offer a more analytical approach, but The Economist might not align with her conservative stance.

Option 3, &quot;Do We Need Stricter Gun Control? - The People Speak (VICE News),&quot; is likely to present diverse opinions, but VICE News might not align with her conservative views.

Option 4, &quot;Gun Banners Say the Darndest Things (Rob Doar),&quot; seems to be more aligned with a pro-gun perspective, which might resonate with her enthusiasm for guns and conservative views.

Option 5, &quot;President Obama: I am not out to get your guns,&quot; might not appeal to her due to the political figure involved, who is often opposed by conservatives.

Considering her profile and viewing history, Option 4 seems to be the most aligned with her interests and political views.

The viewer is an independent conservative who supports a handgun ban but is not very interested in politics or gun policy. Given his support for gun regulation, he might be interested in content that aligns with his views or provides a balanced perspective. Option 5, &quot;Do We Need Stricter Gun Control? - The People Speak,&quot; seems to offer a discussion on gun control, which might align with his support for a handgun ban. It also has a moderate level of engagement, suggesting it could be informative. Option 1, &quot;&quot;I AM THE MAJORITY!&quot;&quot; Full Gun Rights Speech,&quot; and Option 3, &quot;THE MEDIA LOVES MASS SHOOTINGS,&quot; seem to cater more to pro-gun rights perspectives, which might not align with his current viewpoint. Option 4 involves armed activists, which might not appeal to someone who supports a handgun ban. Therefore, Option 5 is the most suitable choice as it directly addresses the topic of gun control.

Given the viewer&#39;s profile as an independent conservative who supports a handgun ban, the viewer might be interested in content that discusses gun control from a perspective that aligns with their views or challenges them. Option 3, &quot;Gun Control and The Violence in Chicago&quot; by Colion Noir, could be appealing as it discusses gun control in a specific context, which might provide insights into the effectiveness of gun control measures. Additionally, Colion Noir is known for his pro-gun stance, which might offer a contrasting viewpoint that the viewer could find engaging. Option 5, &quot;Most Americans Want More Gun Control. Why Doesn’t It Happen?&quot; from NYT, aligns with the viewer&#39;s support for gun regulation and could provide a broader perspective on the challenges of implementing gun control. However, given the viewer&#39;s conservative leanings and the potential interest in contrasting viewpoints, Option 3 might be more engaging. Option 1 and 2 are less likely to align with the viewer&#39;s interests due to their focus on specific events or a more liberal perspective. Therefore, Option 3 seems to be the best choice.

The viewer is a college-educated, independent conservative who supports a handgun ban and has shown interest in gun control topics. He recently watched a video from The New York Times about gun control and completed a significant portion of a debate video from BlazeTV, indicating some interest in diverse perspectives. Option 1, &quot;Democrats Need to Listen to Gun Owners,&quot; might appeal to his conservative and independent leanings by addressing the need for dialogue between gun owners and Democrats. Option 2, &quot;Piers Morgan Argues With Pro-Gun Campaigner About Orlando Shooting,&quot; has high engagement and might attract him due to its debate format, similar to what he has watched before. However, given his support for a handgun ban and the potential interest in understanding different viewpoints, Option 1 seems more aligned with his profile as it might offer a nuanced perspective on gun control that resonates with his independent stance.

<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;think&gt;
The viewer opposes a $15 minimum wage and is currently watching a video advocating for it. They have no recent watch history, but their survey highlights show zero support for a $15 minimum wage. Given this, they might be interested in content that aligns with their viewpoint or provides a critical perspective on the minimum wage increase. 

Option 1, &quot;Who Does a $15 Minimum Wage Help?&quot; from PragerU, likely presents a critical view of the $15 minimum wage, which aligns with the viewer&#39;s stance. PragerU is known for its conservative viewpoints, which might resonate with the viewer&#39;s opposition to the $15 minimum wage.

Option 2, &quot;Walter E Williams - The Effects Of Minimum Wage,&quot; could also be appealing as it might provide an economic analysis of the minimum wage, potentially supporting the viewer&#39;s opposition. However, it has significantly lower engagement compared to Option 1.

Option 3, &quot;What the US gets wrong about minimum wage&quot; from Vox, might present a more liberal perspective, which may not align with the viewer&#39;s current stance.

Option 4, &quot;Caller: Minimum Wage Should be set by Supply &amp; Demand,&quot; might offer an alternative perspective but has very low engagement.

Considering the viewer&#39;s opposition to the $15 minimum wage and the engagement levels, Option 1 seems to be the best fit as it likely aligns with their views and has high engagement.

The viewer opposes a $15 minimum wage and is currently watching a video advocating for raising the minimum wage. Given their opposition, they might be interested in content that aligns with their viewpoint or provides a counterargument. Option 1, &quot;Stossel: Minimum Wage Hurts Beginners,&quot; seems to align with their stance against a $15 minimum wage and could provide arguments supporting their viewpoint. Option 2 discusses setting the minimum wage by supply and demand, which might also appeal to their economic perspective. Option 3 and Option 4 seem to advocate for raising the minimum wage, which might not align with their current viewpoint. Between Option 1 and Option 2, Option 1 has higher engagement and is more likely to resonate with the viewer&#39;s opposition to the minimum wage increase.

The viewer is a 65-year-old who opposes a $15 minimum wage and has recently watched content both supporting and opposing minimum wage increases. They completed a video from MoveOn, which suggests they are open to hearing different perspectives. However, their initial viewpoint and current viewing of Stossel&#39;s video suggest a preference for content that aligns with their opposition to a $15 minimum wage. 

Option 3, &quot;Here’s the Truth About a $15 Minimum Wage&quot; by Rep. Dan Crenshaw, seems to align with their viewpoint and is likely to provide arguments against the $15 minimum wage, which matches their interests. Option 4, &quot;Gutfeld: Seattle&#39;s minimum wage hike failures,&quot; also aligns with their opposition and comes from Fox News, a source that might resonate with their political leanings. Option 2, featuring Thomas Sowell, could also appeal due to its critical stance on minimum wage, but it has significantly lower engagement, which might make it less appealing.

Considering the viewer&#39;s profile and preferences, Option 3 is the best choice as it directly addresses the $15 minimum wage issue and is likely to align with their viewpoint.

<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;think&gt;
The viewer is a 65-year-old who opposes a $15 minimum wage and has shown interest in both sides of the debate, as seen from their recent viewing history. They completed videos from both MoveOn.org, which supports raising the minimum wage, and ReasonTV, which argues against it. This suggests they are open to exploring different perspectives. Given their opposition to a $15 minimum wage, they might be more interested in content that aligns with their views or provides a critical analysis of the minimum wage increase.

Option 3, &quot;Milton Friedman on Minimum Wage,&quot; is likely to align with the viewer&#39;s current stance, as Milton Friedman is known for his free-market economic views, which often include arguments against minimum wage increases. This option also has high engagement, indicating it is a popular and potentially influential video.

Option 1, &quot;The 5 Biggest Myths Republicans Use to Avoid Raising the Minimum Wage,&quot; might not align with the viewer&#39;s current stance, as it seems to challenge arguments against raising the minimum wage, which the viewer opposes.

Option 4, &quot;Walmart CEO: Federal minimum wage should be raised,&quot; presents a corporate perspective that might be of interest, but it advocates for raising the minimum wage, which might not align with the viewer&#39;s current opposition.

Option 2, &quot;Fast Food CEO After Minimum Wage Increase,&quot; is lengthy and might not directly address the viewer&#39;s interest in understanding the arguments against a $15 minimum wage.

Considering the viewer&#39;s profile and viewing history, Option 3 is the most suitable as it aligns with their current opposition to a $15 minimum wage and provides a perspective from a well-known economist.

The viewer opposes a $15 minimum wage and has shown interest in content that aligns with this viewpoint, such as &quot;Stossel: Minimum Wage Hurts Beginners.&quot; The viewer completed this video, indicating strong engagement with content that critiques the minimum wage increase. The viewer also watched a video from NowThis News, which might present a different perspective, but their completion rate suggests less interest in pro-minimum wage content. Given this, option 3, &quot;SOMEONE GIVE HIM A RAISE: Ben Shapiro kills the minimum wage argument for good,&quot; aligns with the viewer&#39;s stance and interest in content that critiques the minimum wage. Ben Shapiro is known for conservative viewpoints, which may resonate with the viewer&#39;s opposition to the $15 minimum wage. Additionally, this option has high engagement, suggesting it is popular and potentially persuasive. Option 1 and 2 present arguments for raising the minimum wage, which may not align with the viewer&#39;s current stance. Option 4 seems less relevant due to its length and focus on a specific industry. Therefore, option 3 is the best choice.

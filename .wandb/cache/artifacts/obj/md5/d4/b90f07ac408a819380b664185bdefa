Charles Koch and Republicans are not in favor of a $15 minimum wage, while Senator Bernie Sanders supports it. Thom Hartmann Program covers both perspectives. Warren Buffett argues against a minimum wage because it punishes those he sees as \"the city's forgotten people.\" Based on this argument, characterizing Charles Koch and supporters of increasing the minimum wage as \"remembering the people\" would be a contradiction in terms. Conservative pushback activists would likely support Kennedy's point, as they advocate for lower or no minimum wage. Considering the tone of Edgar's video, his message is devoid of sympathy for the working class or an emphasis on personal integrity among workers, such as not exploiting them.

There is no hint that he's particularly concerned with income inequality other than the minimum wage, or he prefers welfare instead.

She is interested in demographics such as being female, White, and in the $10,000-$14,999 income range. Her background suggests she values news sources that appeal to her liberal lean, moderately interested in current affairs, and watches YouTube multiple times a week. The content of the current YouTube video is about discussions on fast food CEOs regarding the minimum wage policy and its impact on workers. Some other videos provided are related to income inequality and jobs, none of which meet her criteria. Malcolm Kenyatta's video discusses African issues and does not align with her liberal political interests. Callers discussing minimum wage scales better fit, but the responses often take longer, so they move on to a more concise video. Fox News\u2019s clip on whether Seattle's increase in the minimum wage has been a failure does not align with her interests, and her sub-criteria suggest the Phil Stewart cartoon video published reveals more interest in political correctness than her requirement. Thom Hartmann's program addresses income inequality and should be relevant but neither video meets the sliding scale-help option interest she checks off on each wave, minimizing her video time concerns.  \n\n3", 0.0, 0.0], ["6", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are choosing EXACTLY ONE item from a short slate for a specific viewer.\n\nInput you will see:\n  \u2022 Viewer profile and optional context/history\n  \u2022 An \"OPTIONS:\" list with items numbered 1..N\n    \u2013 Each item is shown as either a title (preferred) or an id\n\nYour job:\n  \u2022 Think briefly in <think>\u2026</think> using the viewer\u2019s profile, context, and options.\n  \u2022 Compare the top 2\u20133 candidates, then choose the single best option.\n  \u2022 Never invent new items; choose only from the given OPTIONS list.\n\nOutput format (STRICT):\n  \u2022 First output your hidden reasoning in <think>\u2026</think>.\n    \u2013 In your thinking, reference candidates by their numbers and names (or ids) to justify the choice.\n  \u2022 Then output ONLY the chosen option\u2019s NUMBER inside <answer>\u2026</answer>.\n    \u2013 Do NOT output the name, id, or any extra text\u2014ONLY the number.\n    \u2013 Do NOT include punctuation, quotes, or a period after the number.\n\nExamples of valid <answer>:\n  <answer>\n  3\n  </answer>\n\nExamples of INVALID <answer> (never do these):\n  <answer>3.</answer>                 \u2190 trailing period\n  <answer>\"3\"</answer>                \u2190 quoted\n  <answer>Option 3</answer>           \u2190 extra words\n  <answer>Parkland \u2026</answer>         \u2190 name instead of number\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nPROFILE:\n(no profile provided)\n\nSESSION CONTEXT:\n- Issue: minimum_wage\n- Issue detail: derived from video ct8CGJy9eF8\n- Issue source: tree_metadata\n- Session ID: oWFCDu4eN4U8TMnCJss7\n- Step: 2\n- Slate source: session_log\n- Options in slate: 4\n\nCURRENT VIDEO:\nRaise The Minimum Wage -- Robert Reich & MoveOn.org \u2014 channel: MoveOn\n\nOPTIONS:\n1.

I also pushed against Hartmann's two-thirds but not three-thirds trigger. After spending months, teaching the principles that the minimum wage should refer to a wage at least $15 per hour, I found that the minimum wage meekly follows the hours that the majority in the US work. Because of this, the economic benefits and corrective actions encourage employers to pay wage increases, not as a stimulus but as a value proposition.\n\nAmerica's above-average pay stands as a privilege of its nation state charter rather than any typical outcome in any changes. The quota for those strictly below the very low standard in minimum wages becomes higher in the average wages. Congress shows no planned approval to liberal and libertarian benefits for taxing, economic hypothesis and business charter against millions of Americans that directly.\n\n<answer>4</answer>", 0.0, -1.4997000694274902], ["100", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are choosing EXACTLY ONE item from a short slate for a specific viewer.\n\nInput you will see:\n  \u2022 Viewer profile and optional context/history\n  \u2022 An \"OPTIONS:\" list with items numbered 1..N\n    \u2013 Each item is shown as either a title (preferred) or an id\n\nYour job:\n  \u2022 Think briefly in <think>\u2026</think> using the viewer\u2019s profile, context, and options.\n  \u2022 Compare the top 2\u20133 candidates, then choose the single best option.\n  \u2022 Never invent new items; choose only from the given OPTIONS list.\n\nOutput format (STRICT):\n  \u2022 First output your hidden reasoning in <think>\u2026</think>.\n    \u2013 In your thinking, reference candidates by their numbers and names (or ids) to justify the choice.\n  \u2022 Then output ONLY the chosen option\u2019s NUMBER inside <answer>\u2026</answer>.\n    \u2013 Do NOT output the name, id, or any extra text\u2014ONLY the number.\n    \u2013 Do NOT include punctuation, quotes, or a period after the number.\n\nExamples of valid <answer>:\n  <answer>\n  3\n  </answer>\n\nExamples of INVALID <answer> (never do these):\n  <answer>3.</answer>                 \u2190 trailing period\n  <answer>\"3\"</answer>                \u2190 quoted\n  <answer>Option 3</answer>           \u2190 extra words\n  <answer>Parkland \u2026</answer>         \u2190 name instead of number\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nPROFILE:\n(no profile provided)\n\nSESSION CONTEXT:\n- Issue: minimum_wage\n- Issue detail: derived from video rQj1qlsjVoM\n- Issue source: tree_metadata\n- Session ID: pcgLGATNLpepSuTCgXN2\n- Step: 4\n- Slate source: session_log\n- Options in slate: 4\n\nCURRENT VIDEO:\nA $15 minimum wage would hurt those it's meant to help \u2014 channel: Learn Liberty\n\nHISTORY (most recent first):\n1.

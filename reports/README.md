# Reports Overview

This directory surfaces analyst-facing summaries that pair with the modeling and data-processing workflows in the repository. Each subfolder owns the regenerated Markdown, tables, and figures for a specific track so you can browse results without digging through `models/` or raw logs.

- `gpt4o/` — catalog of GPT-4o baselines, including the selected `next_video/` evaluation slice and the `hyperparameter_tuning/` sweep that produced it. Refresh via `python -m gpt4o.pipeline` or the helper script `training/training-gpt4o.sh`.
- `grpo/` — GRPO finetuning evaluation catalog with `next_video/` ranking metrics and `opinion/` regression summaries. Refresh via `python -m grpo.pipeline --stage reports`.
- `grail/` — GRAIL (GRPO+discriminator) evaluation artifacts mirroring the GRPO layout; regenerate with `python -m grail.pipeline --stage reports` once `models/grail/` contains the latest runs.
- `knn/` — KNN recommendation and opinion-regression reports, complete with sample prompts, training instructions, and per-`k` diagnostics for TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Sentence-Transformer feature spaces. Regenerated by `python -m knn.pipeline`; the report builders now live in the modular package `src/knn/pipeline_reports/` (`catalog.py`, `hyperparameter.py`, `next_video.py`, `opinion.py`) so it is easier to extend individual sections without touching a monolithic file.
- `prompt_builder/` — representative prompts emitted by `prompt_builder.build_user_prompt`, illustrating how cleaned GRAIL sessions render for different issues, splits, and studies.
- `prompt_stats/` — dataset coverage notes, demographic completeness tables, and slate/prior-history histograms for the cleaned sessions; figures live under `figures/` and come from the prompt-statistics notebook. Upstream ingestion details are documented in `clean_data/sessions/README.md`.
- `research_article_political_sciences/` — replication of the Liu et al. (PNAS 2025) polarization analyses, including pre/post opinion tables, treatment-control contrasts, and stratified effect sizes.
- `visualized_recommendation_trees/` — Graphviz exports of representative interaction trees for gun-control and minimum-wage sessions; regenerate with `python -m src.visualization.recommendation_tree_viz`.
- `xgb/` — XGBoost baseline artifacts mirroring the KNN layout (next-video rankings, opinion models, and tuning notes) regenerated by `python -m xgb.pipeline` or `training/training-xgb.sh`.

Regeneration commands assume `PYTHONPATH=src` and rely on the cleaned dataset under `data/cleaned_grail`. Downstream reports write their own Markdown so this overview can stay stable while individual subdirectories refresh after new experiments.

name: Short-term exposure to filter-bubble algorithmic recommendations have limited
  effects on polarization
description: An enormous literature argues that recommendation algorithms drive political
  polarization by creating "filter bubbles" and "rabbit holes." Using four experiments
  with nearly 9,000 participants, we show that manipulating algorithmic recommendations
  to create these conditions has limited effects on opinions. Our experiments employ
  a custom-built video platform with a naturalistic, YouTube-like interface presenting
  real YouTube videos and recommendations. We experimentally manipulate YouTube's
  actual recommendation algorithm to simulate "filter bubbles" and "rabbit holes"
  by presenting ideologically balanced and slanted choices. Our design allows us to
  intervene in a feedback loop that has confounded the study of algorithmic polarization—the
  complex interplay between *supply* of recommendations and user *demand* for content—to
  examine downstream effects on policy attitudes. We use over 130,000 experimentally
  manipulated recommendations and 31,000 platform interactions to estimate how recommendation
  algorithms alter users' media consumption decisions and, indirectly, their political
  attitudes. Our results cast doubt on widely circulating theories of algorithmic
  polarization by showing that even heavy-handed (although short-term) perturbations
  of real-world recommendations have limited causal effects on policy attitudes. Given
  our inability to detect consistent evidence for algorithmic effects, we argue the
  burden of proof for claims about algorithm-induced polarization has shifted. Our
  methodology, which captures and modifies the output of real-world recommendation
  algorithms, offers a path forward for future investigations of black-box artificial
  intelligence systems. Our findings reveal practical limits to effect sizes that
  are feasibly detectable in academic experiments.

The CBO stats say a minimum wage hikes will cut over a million jobs by 2025. But there's some incentive for getting the wage up. If the minimum wage has a problem, then raising it may fix the problem. Inflation caps workers' increases. A minimum wageocide itself doesn't cause much inflation, considering 1 in 15 minimum-wage workers are going to be less than one year old. That could wind up being a negative. But maybe increasing the minimum by 15 is necessary and useful. It would go a long way to invest in elderly, laid off and disadvantaged workers. Those folks need an injection of an economic bailout.

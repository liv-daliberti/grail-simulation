While Joe Manchin could stand between Biden and a $15 minimum wage hike, the video is about those Congressional debates and potential actions. Briahna Joy Gray offers a liberal perspective on why the $15 minimum wage should not be voted down, which aligns most closely with the discussion and the viewers introduced. The TVL and RBID source legends are consistent with this postive view and the liberal's standpoint.\n\n4. think:\n\nMe:viewers\\d paints a picture of a conservative who would support proposing $16/hr  Minimum Wage\nTherefore, the best answer is\n<answer>\n1\n</answer>", 0.0, -0.4999000132083893], ["185", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are choosing EXACTLY ONE item from a short slate for a specific viewer.\n\nInput you will see:\n  \u2022 Viewer profile and optional context/history\n  \u2022 An \"OPTIONS:\" list with items numbered 1..N\n    \u2013 Each item is shown as either a title (preferred) or an id\n\nYour job:\n  \u2022 Think briefly in <think>\u2026</think> using the viewer\u2019s profile, context, and options.\n  \u2022 Compare the top 2\u20133 candidates, then choose the single best option.\n  \u2022 Never invent new items; choose only from the given OPTIONS list.\n\nOutput format (STRICT):\n  \u2022 First output your hidden reasoning in <think>\u2026</think>.\n    \u2013 In your thinking, reference candidates by their numbers and names (or ids) to justify the choice.\n  \u2022 Then output ONLY the chosen option\u2019s NUMBER inside <answer>\u2026</answer>.\n    \u2013 Do NOT output the name, id, or any extra text\u2014ONLY the number.\n    \u2013 Do NOT include punctuation, quotes, or a period after the number.\n\nExamples of valid <answer>:\n  <answer>\n  3\n  </answer>\n\nExamples of INVALID <answer> (never do these):\n  <answer>3.</answer>                 \u2190 trailing period\n  <answer>\"3\"</answer>                \u2190 quoted\n  <answer>Option 3</answer>           \u2190 extra words\n  <answer>Parkland \u2026</answer>         \u2190 name instead of number\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nPROFILE:\n(no profile provided)\n\nSESSION CONTEXT:\n- Issue: minimum_wage\n- Issue detail: derived from video 2voNlYS-8C0\n- Issue source: tree_metadata\n- Session ID: 1qjLtopVcfpzR3XRf3f5\n- Step: 4\n- Slate source: session_log\n- Options in slate: 4\n\nCURRENT VIDEO:\nBiden's minimum wage hike will kill 1.4M jobs: CBO \u2014 channel: Fox News\n\nHISTORY (most recent first):\n1.

Given their liberal ideology and interest in issues like minimum wage, Charles Koch's statements ('No Minimum Wage will Help the Poor'), but not directly mentioning support for such a increase, seem to align best with political beliefs and interests of a liberal Democrat overlapping the minimum wage philosophy perspective. \nWhile the next top candidate, \"If a Business Won't pay a Living Wage - it Shouldn't exist,\" is emphasized and highlights wage adjustments directly on purchasing power and competitiveness, it's by a channel different from those mentioned. Trotsky (particularly Carl to) while well-balanced, does not resonate as well with the context of minimal wage minimum views observed. Therefore, the best continuing hitting and [arguably] best fit here aligns with the non-aligned view.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", 0.0, 0.0], ["185", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are choosing EXACTLY ONE item from a short slate for a specific viewer.\n\nInput you will see:\n  \u2022 Viewer profile and optional context/history\n  \u2022 An \"OPTIONS:\" list with items numbered 1..N\n    \u2013 Each item is shown as either a title (preferred) or an id\n\nYour job:\n  \u2022 Think briefly in <think>\u2026</think> using the viewer\u2019s profile, context, and options.\n  \u2022 Compare the top 2\u20133 candidates, then choose the single best option.\n  \u2022 Never invent new items; choose only from the given OPTIONS list.\n\nOutput format (STRICT):\n  \u2022 First output your hidden reasoning in <think>\u2026</think>.\n    \u2013 In your thinking, reference candidates by their numbers and names (or ids) to justify the choice.\n  \u2022 Then output ONLY the chosen option\u2019s NUMBER inside <answer>\u2026</answer>.\n    \u2013 Do NOT output the name, id, or any extra text\u2014ONLY the number.\n    \u2013 Do NOT include punctuation, quotes, or a period after the number.\n\nExamples of valid <answer>:\n  <answer>\n  3\n  </answer>\n\nExamples of INVALID <answer> (never do these):\n  <answer>3.</answer>                 \u2190 trailing period\n  <answer>\"3\"</answer>                \u2190 quoted\n  <answer>Option 3</answer>           \u2190 extra words\n  <answer>Parkland \u2026</answer>         \u2190 name instead of number\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nPROFILE:\n(no profile provided)\n\nSESSION CONTEXT:\n- Issue: minimum_wage\n- Issue detail: derived from video SSx7gcMKjQY\n- Issue source: tree_metadata\n- Session ID: vxzRllVXWqSAKvbiDgol\n- Step: 3\n- Slate source: tree_fallback\n- Options in slate: 5\n\nCURRENT VIDEO:\nWhy We Need to Raise Minimum Wage to $15 An Hour... \u2014 channel: Thom Hartmann Program\n\nHISTORY (most recent first):\n1.

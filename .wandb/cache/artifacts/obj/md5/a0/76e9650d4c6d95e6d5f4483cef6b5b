They supported a $15 minimum wage (wave 1), but their support is conditional. The demographics suggest they might be more concerned about the potential negative impacts on jobs rather than the revenue of companies, aligning them more with a version of the issue than the full documentary/video length. They are using YouTube, which typically features discussions on current affairs and less heavy content. The options cover moderate views on minimum wage with discussion of benefits and impacts without endorsing increased wages, and the current slate recommends discussing what they get wrong about the issue as opposed to directly supporting increased minimum wages. Therefore, the best immediate recommendation is the same information-type that fits their moderate, influence-seeking ideology\u2014versus businesses excessively benefitting. Milton Friedman's History on the minimum wage is not my top pick, due to what they want to know and not what they get wrong.

Hence, PragerU emerges as the most effective and potent context here.\n\n<answer>4</answer>", 0.0, -0.8658754229545593], ["3", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are choosing EXACTLY ONE item from a short slate for a specific viewer.\n\nInput you will see:\n  \u2022 Viewer profile and optional context/history\n  \u2022 An \"OPTIONS:\" list with items numbered 1..N\n    \u2013 Each item is shown as either a title (preferred) or an id\n\nYour job:\n  \u2022 Think briefly in <think>\u2026</think> using the viewer\u2019s profile, context, and options.\n  \u2022 Compare the top 2\u20133 candidates, then choose the single best option.\n  \u2022 Never invent new items; choose only from the given OPTIONS list.\n\nOutput format (STRICT):\n  \u2022 First output your hidden reasoning in <think>\u2026</think>.\n    \u2013 In your thinking, reference candidates by their numbers and names (or ids) to justify the choice.\n  \u2022 Then output ONLY the chosen option\u2019s NUMBER inside <answer>\u2026</answer>.\n    \u2013 Do NOT output the name, id, or any extra text\u2014ONLY the number.\n    \u2013 Do NOT include punctuation, quotes, or a period after the number.\n\nExamples of valid <answer>:\n  <answer>\n  3\n  </answer>\n\nExamples of INVALID <answer> (never do these):\n  <answer>3.</answer>                 \u2190 trailing period\n  <answer>\"3\"</answer>                \u2190 quoted\n  <answer>Option 3</answer>           \u2190 extra words\n  <answer>Parkland \u2026</answer>         \u2190 name instead of number\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nPROFILE:\n38-year-old, man, Caucasian/White (non-Hispanic), democrat liberal, $25,000-$29,999, watches YouTube daily\n\nDEMOGRAPHICS:\n- Age: 38\n- Gender: Man\n- Race/ethnicity: Caucasian/White (non-Hispanic)\n- College: not college educated\n- Household income: $25,000-$29,999\n\nPOLITICS:\n- Party identification: Democrat\n- Party lean: Not very strong Democrat\n- Ideology: Liberal\n- Political interest: 3\n\nMINIMUM WAGE:\n- Minimum wage stance (wave 1, inferred): 0.46\n- Minimum wage stance (wave 2, inferred): 0.55\n- Minimum wage stance (wave 1, survey): 13.50\n- Minimum wage stance (wave 2, survey): 11.25\n- Minimum wage support index (wave 1): 0.15819444444444444\n- Minimum wage support index (wave 2): 0.43333333333333335\n- $15 minimum wage support (wave 1): 0.25\n- $15 minimum wage support (wave 2): 0.75\n- Supports wage increase (wave 1): no\n- Supports wage increase (wave 2): no\n- Minimum wage howhigh w1: 0\n- Minimum wage howhigh w2: 0.25\n- Minimum wage help w1: 0.2222222222222222\n- Minimum wage help w2: 0.2222222222222222\n- Minimum wage restrict w1: 0.3333333333333333\n- Minimum wage restrict w2: 0.4444444444444444\n\nMEDIA HABITS:\n- YouTube frequency: daily\n\nSESSION CONTEXT:\n- Issue: minimum_wage\n- Issue detail: derived from video rQj1qlsjVoM\n- Issue source: tree_metadata\n- Session ID: NLi5klnZItDVlNHPHk1v\n- Step: 3\n- Slate source: session_log\n- Options in slate: 4\n\nCURRENT VIDEO:\nMilton Friedman on Minimum Wage \u2014 channel: amagilly\n\nHISTORY (most recent first):\n1.

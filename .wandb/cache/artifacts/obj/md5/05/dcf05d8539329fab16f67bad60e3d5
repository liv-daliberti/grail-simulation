Thom Hartmann on the minimum-wage issue disagrees almost the entire time but the availability of the causal argument is very preferred. Joe Rogan seems to be gaining moderate attention with such a particular wave of focus towards it. Ben Shapiro per se, presents the target on a disadvantageously stagnant fund, which is not market responsive.

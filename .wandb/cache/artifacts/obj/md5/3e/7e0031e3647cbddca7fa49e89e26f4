Given these demographics and political leanings, the context of the current content (Why did Amazon agree to raise its minimum wage), and given the option of David Pakman Show and Fox Business, which generalize this issue across various contexts without specific cash targets, it seems the viewer might resonate more with the general idea rather than a specific minimum wage rate, albeit grappling with the complexities involved.\n\nIn summary, the viewer seems aligned with the general themes discussed, and her affinity for progressive issues makes Amazon specifically lifting the minimum wage easier to relate with. But specific numbers or rates across different companies' justifications push the viewer towards more abstract discussions and more comprehensive perspectives.

It overlaps with the previous session where it was indicated she supports a minimum wage increase, so it's likely this is a follow-up where she shows an active interest in the topic and may influence her earlier views.\n\nThe video she engages with suggests it's from a Conservative point of view, and the discussion seems related to supporting higher than the minimum wage. This aligns with her ideology as a liberal and support for minimum wage increase being mentioned in the context, but the minimum wage increase policy and the context are partially contradictory in nature.\n\nTherefore, a video from a conservative angle aligns with her interest in the topic and supports the concept of higher wages, which aligns with her financial stance and economic belief in wage increase across most measures.

However, these videos were created by users with high minimum wage approval scores, which might be a concern for min-wage-conservative views.

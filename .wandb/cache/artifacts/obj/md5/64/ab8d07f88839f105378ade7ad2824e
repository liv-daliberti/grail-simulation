The fourth option talks more about economic implications. Given the step, I consider ensuring minimum wage can influence sales in light of the math change. The channel cuts across irrespective of politics, suggesting it would not be the best fit for this decision. But combining the history viewpoint of the issue and the current video context, perhaps reviewing the entire statement is in order to integrate the speaker who combined a stances to repeatedly believe the economic nuances of intermediate job loss. I can feasibly reason: The panel brings reforms to public understanding.

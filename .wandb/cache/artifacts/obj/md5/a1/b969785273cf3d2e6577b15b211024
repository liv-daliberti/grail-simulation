Walmart CEO: Federal minimum wage should be raised \u2014 channel: CNBC Television<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "In <think>\nThe issues at hand are the effects of minimum wages and the views on increases in minimum wages on society. With options targeting these issues, the best choice is likely to be the one that clearly addresses either the effects of minimum wages or provides expert opinion on how to raise the minimum wage, respectively.\n\nFrom the list, I see:\n- Option 1 is about Walter E Williams, who doesn\u2019t focus on minimum wages.\n- Option 2 discusses what the US gets wrong about minimum wages, which aligns with the issue at hand.\n- Option 3 talks about a specific CEO not in the public attention.\n- Option 4 discusses reflections on a large corporation's stance on equal treatment.\n\nConsidering the viewer's profile hasn\u2019t been provided, the likely focus is on the effects or raising of minimum wages, making both 2 and 1 suitable.

The viewer watches YouTube a few times a month, indicating they are an active YouTube user. This behavior suggests they may seek views from organizations or individuals who advocate for their interests and support the liberal political ideology.\n\n### Analysis and Selection:\n- Option 1 is about a Fast Food CEO after the minimum wage increase, which doesn't align with the viewer's liberal background. It's a business perspective focused on reactions from influential figures, but not a direct support for a liberal stance.\n- Option 2 is about restaurants eliminating employees from states where minimum wage hikes occurred. This focuses on state-level issues and company-level reactions, strongly aligned with business concerns.\n- Option 3 discusses Seattle's minimum wage hike impacting jobs, aligning well with an interest in employment and economic impacts.\n- Option 4 is about Republicans blocking a minimum wage increase and isn't relevant to the viewer\u2019s political leanings.\n\nGiven the YouTube frequency, the likelihood of engaging with business or company-level views is low.

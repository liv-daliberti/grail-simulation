Number 3 is directly related and usually more directly tied to political neutrality.\n\nOptions: 1 and 2 give minimal numerical information. While 2 (Someone Give Him A Raise) is highly related and directly related to the content of the video, option 1 (US gets wrong about minimum wage) does not have this detail and is syndicated with dedicated opposition.\nTherefore, number 3 seems to address the same topic in great depth.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n1\n</answer>", 1.0, 0.0], ["178", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are choosing EXACTLY ONE item from a short slate for a specific viewer.\n\nInput you will see:\n  \u2022 Viewer profile and optional context/history\n  \u2022 An \"OPTIONS:\" list with items numbered 1..N\n    \u2013 Each item is shown as either a title (preferred) or an id\n\nYour job:\n  \u2022 Think briefly in <think>\u2026</think> using the viewer\u2019s profile, context, and options.\n  \u2022 Compare the top 2\u20133 candidates, then choose the single best option.\n  \u2022 Never invent new items; choose only from the given OPTIONS list.\n\nOutput format (STRICT):\n  \u2022 First output your hidden reasoning in <think>\u2026</think>.\n    \u2013 In your thinking, reference candidates by their numbers and names (or ids) to justify the choice.\n  \u2022 Then output ONLY the chosen option\u2019s NUMBER inside <answer>\u2026</answer>.\n    \u2013 Do NOT output the name, id, or any extra text\u2014ONLY the number.\n    \u2013 Do NOT include punctuation, quotes, or a period after the number.\n\nExamples of valid <answer>:\n  <answer>\n  3\n  </answer>\n\nExamples of INVALID <answer> (never do these):\n  <answer>3.</answer>                 \u2190 trailing period\n  <answer>\"3\"</answer>                \u2190 quoted\n  <answer>Option 3</answer>           \u2190 extra words\n  <answer>Parkland \u2026</answer>         \u2190 name instead of number\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nPROFILE:\n(no profile provided)\n\nSESSION CONTEXT:\n- Issue: minimum_wage\n- Issue detail: derived from video ct8CGJy9eF8\n- Issue source: tree_metadata\n- Session ID: no8hbTTQheUqCvwF4CSy\n- Step: 4\n- Slate source: session_log\n- Options in slate: 4\n\nCURRENT VIDEO:\nShould We Raise the Minimum Wage? \u2014 channel: vlogbrothers\n\nHISTORY (most recent first):\n1.

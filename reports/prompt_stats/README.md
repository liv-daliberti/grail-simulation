## Dataset coverage notes

Builder note: rows missing all survey demographics (age, gender, race, income, etc.)
are dropped during cleaning so every retained interaction has viewer context.
This removes roughly 22% of the ~33k raw interactions.

> "The short answer is that sessions.json contains EVERYTHING.
Every test run, every study.
In addition to the studies that involved watching videos on the platform,
it also contains sessions from the “First Impressions” study and the “Shorts” study
(Study 4 in the paper).
Those sessions involved no user decisions.
Instead they played predetermined videos that were
either constant or increasing in their extremeness.
All are differentiated by the topicId." — Emily Hu (University of Pennsylvania)

- Original study participants: 1,650 (Study 1 — gun rights)
  1,679 (Study 2 — minimum wage MTurk), and 2,715 (Study 3 — minimum wage YouGov).
- Cleaned dataset participants captured here: 88 (gun control)
  and 1058 (minimum wage).
  Study 4 (Shorts) is excluded because the released interaction logs
  do not contain recommendation slates.
- Shortfall summary (Studies 1–3 only):
  - Study 1 (gun control MTurk): 1650 expected vs. 88 usable (-1562).
    98 sessions log only the starter clip (`vids` length = 1) and 15 log multiple clips but no recommendation slate (`displayOrders` empty).
  - Study 2 (minimum wage MTurk): 1679 expected vs. 377 usable (-1302).
    14 sessions log only the starter clip; 17 have multiple clips but no slate metadata (`displayOrders` empty).
  - Study 3 (minimum wage YouGov): 2715 expected vs. 633 usable (-2082).
    No gap — interaction logs are complete.
- Only gun-control and minimum-wage sessions (Studies 1–3) are retained;
  other topic IDs from the capsule are excluded.

The first two options discuss the impact of increasing minimum wage in Seattle and the economics of $15 and lower minimum wage, while the third option appears to address another different aspect of the minimum wage.\n\nThe original video appears to align with the topic of the economic minimum wage. Therefore, the Likely Next Thing To Happen should resemble a facts-based discussion of the minimum wage and its impacts. The fourth option is too controversial with an id, which does not align well with the recurring topic. \n\nThe options seem more aligned with the economic discussion, but the title Amazon hikes minimum wage is held as a current update. I am unsure if the correct answer would better establish a historical or traditional rebuttal for this standpoint, yet a possible guideline should rely on economic principles for an up-to-date, traditional construction number.

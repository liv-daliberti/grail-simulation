# Reports Overview

This directory surfaces analyst-facing summaries that pair with the modeling and data-processing workflows in the repository. Each subfolder owns the regenerated Markdown, tables, and figures for a specific track so you can browse results without digging through `models/` or raw logs.

- `gpt4o/` — catalog of GPT-4o baselines, including the selected `next_video/` evaluation slice and the `hyperparameter_tuning/` sweep that produced it. Refresh via `python -m gpt4o.pipeline` or the helper script `training/training-gpt4o.sh`.
- `knn/` — KNN recommendation and opinion-regression reports, complete with sample prompts, training instructions, and per-`k` diagnostics for TF-IDF and Word2Vec feature spaces. Regenerated by `python -m knn.pipeline`.
- `prompt_builder/` — representative prompts emitted by `prompt_builder.build_user_prompt`, illustrating how cleaned GRAIL sessions render for different issues, splits, and studies.
- `prompt_stats/` — dataset coverage notes, demographic completeness tables, and slate/prior-history histograms for the cleaned sessions; figures live under `figures/` and come from the prompt-statistics notebook.
- `research_article_political_sciences/` — replication of the Liu et al. (PNAS 2025) polarization analyses, including pre/post opinion tables, treatment-control contrasts, and stratified effect sizes.
- `visualized_recommendation_trees/` — Graphviz exports of representative interaction trees for gun-control and minimum-wage sessions; regenerate with `python -m src.visualization.recommendation_tree_viz`.
- `xgb/` — XGBoost baseline artifacts mirroring the KNN layout (next-video rankings, opinion models, and tuning notes) regenerated by `python -m xgb.pipeline` or `training/training-xgb.sh`.

Regeneration commands assume `PYTHONPATH=src` and rely on the cleaned dataset under `data/cleaned_grail`. Downstream reports write their own Markdown so this overview can stay stable while individual subdirectories refresh after new experiments.

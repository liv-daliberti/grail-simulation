The senator mentioned in the video is Joe Manchin, and the options all deal with raising the minimum wage to $15. Given Joe Manchin's position on the topic, we can conclude that option 1 is highly unlikely to happen, and the others are less uncertain in relation to him.  \nGiven the history of options 2 and 3, while they address the minimum wage, they seem to be less aligned with actual conversations about Joe Manchin's stance.\n\nOption 4 mentions a platform that shows actual consequences of $15 minimum wage. This could lend credibility to the \"not happening\" aspect as a topic to drag up on this channel. But considering the context, it's a bold claim, and manchint is rarely viewed as someone who pushes for significant proposals like this until these specifics come under scrutiny during a presidential race....  \nConsidering the conservative profile of the moderator in the video (focused on Joe Manchin's stance), adding an unbiased view from an envoi channel could heighten the potential impact.

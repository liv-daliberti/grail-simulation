Social media videos, often discussing economic impacts of a higher minimum wage, lean on Chris Rock's similar reasoning. The current slate suggests there isn't much unease with the issue and it opens up Joe Rogan's.\nHowever, the candidates focused on addressing a higher or a refunded minimum wage which Republicans appear to be most opposed to.

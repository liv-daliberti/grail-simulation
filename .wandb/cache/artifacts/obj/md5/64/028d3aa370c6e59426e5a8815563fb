Walter E Williams - The Effects Of Minimum Wage \u2014 channel: LibertyPen<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>  \nGiven the viewer profile and interests, the most relevant video from the current plethora would likely to balance their concerns. Option 4, 'Walter E Williams - The Effects of Minimum Wage', seems suitable as it talks about W.E. Williams, criticized by liberals, and follows directly on the issue label from 'What the US gets wrong about minimum wage'. Yet, Option 1 is also critically hubicient, and Option 2 and Option 4 don't go as far in supporting the liberal viewpoint. The Modal lack of alignment to liberal support points towards the tint that Tarre could favor or align downithere, hence, I will choose Option 1.  \n</think>  \n\n<answer>1</answer>", 1.0, 0.4999000132083893]], "log_mode": "IMMUTABLE", "ncols": 5, "nrows": 224}

"""Reference mapping between Qualtrics question IDs and friendly feature names.

This table helps us keep track of where each prompt feature originates in the
CodeOcean survey exports.  The ``question_ids`` list contains the raw column
names observed across the intermediate CSVs for Studies 1â€“4.  When the builder
renames or aggregates features, refer back here to understand which Qualtrics
items are involved.

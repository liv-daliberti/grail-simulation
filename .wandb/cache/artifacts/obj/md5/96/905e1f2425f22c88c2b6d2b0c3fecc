The available options appear to be related to companies or businesses and their minimum wage.  \n4 == Answer\n<answer>1</answer>  \n\nThe other options are all about inflation, which doesn't directly relate to the subject. Inflation is a general increase in prices, typically occurring after businesses apply their minimum wage. Therefore, the focus should be on minimum wage and its practical implications in companies or businesses owning the right to make meat the minimum wage for their employees. \n\nLet's take a step back and analyze the overall image associated with the channel Thom Hartmann Program:It is a video providing in-depth analysis on various economic issues related to labor, job markets, and corporate influence on government policies.  \nNow finding a minimum wage argument that does not relink with inflation contradicts the current slate options, suggesting that the viewer is seeking a minimum wage argument or analysis, not about inflation.

Malcolm Kenyatta's stance on the issue focuses on universality, considered reasonable and evidence based as opposed to someone like PragerU which is more focused on immediate job impacts and jobs. Therefore, PragerU is the right choice. My reasoning is based on that the most significant concept from the video is inequality and how it has been being satisfied from both sides - some people getting rich and others getting haggled off their wages. PragerU divides society into two categories and looks to explain why it does not provide universal wages. Malcolm Kenyatta further seeks to cover all possible behaviours that occur in life. and while both authors cover tax talk, the statistics never connect one with the other. I'll choose the one who solely looks at inequality, not everyone receives average employment now. Maximising employees to run sole businessman. Role of the state in carrying out least rich people ends economic transaction. Independence bridges economic barriers across city sections.resolve for broader awareness of subject and critical analysis of solutions across the board for individual. Hence pragerU is The Tail PE that one can't defend against greatest significane.

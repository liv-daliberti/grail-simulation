The ON stands out as a viewpoint that discusses the $15 minimum wage. It also mentions how it affects businesses, which fits well within the issue thread of the question. The B has potential as well, as the panel mentions standing between Biden and $15 hikes, making it relevant to the issue. The other options, while relevant in other contexts, don't fit as seamlessly as the ON or B as the current tech trend has shifted slightly towards New Democrats, and hence, ON doesn't have quite as deep of an immediate subtext on Biden vs 15 minimum wages. \n\nGiven the audience's demographics, Rachel Joy Gray's viewpoint might have more resonance due to her more generationally progressive perspective on family values and women's issues while still adhering to her advocate of the wage increase.

Option 2 seems like it identifies as conservative because it's a move by Thom Hartmann, while the minimum wage support index in option 3 is up to 0.07250000000000001 which might be marginally lower. Gutfeld doesn't align with Democrat/liberal, and Malcolm Kenyatta's video might be more suitable as it directly opposes raising the minimum wage. He's very interested in political issues and is leaning that the Senator would be ineffective in solving the problem unless increased minimum wages aren't too low.

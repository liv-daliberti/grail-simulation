Option 1 discusses more abstract concepts and the cost-effectiveness of increasing minimum wage, not the direct impact.\n\nI think the most relevant choice is Option 4. It consistently mentions the $15 minimum wage and discusses whether it might have a negative impact on jobs effectively. However, \"minimum wage cost Me My Job\" also raises interesting themes of the societal impact sometimes. Therefore, choosing option 4 also covers cost and its effect on job market.

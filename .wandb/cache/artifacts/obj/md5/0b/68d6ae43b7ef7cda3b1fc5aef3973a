Given the nuances of the context, the video \"Uh-Oh: Was the $15 Minimum Wage Just DESTROYED?! \" stands out due to the explicit nature of its content, which aligns closely with the question.\n\nThe issue seems to be related to the externalization of costs from companies to employees, notably seen as failing to raise the minimum wage even though it results in the owner's higher profits. The self-statements in this input indicate a strong stance against raising the base minimum wage, which suggests that the issue is within the realm of cost loaning from employers to employees. Among the viewers' comments, option 5 seems to address this issue directly.\n\nThe other options appear to be discussing macroeconomic effects rather than the issue stemming from promoting or opposing the minimum income wage, an issue discussed in the context of the question.\r\n</think>", 0.0, -1.4997000694274902], ["46", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are choosing EXACTLY ONE item from a short slate for a specific viewer.\n\nInput you will see:\n  \u2022 Viewer profile and optional context/history\n  \u2022 An \"OPTIONS:\" list with items numbered 1..N\n    \u2013 Each item is shown as either a title (preferred) or an id\n\nYour job:\n  \u2022 Think briefly in <think>\u2026</think> using the viewer\u2019s profile, context, and options.\n  \u2022 Compare the top 2\u20133 candidates, then choose the single best option.\n  \u2022 Never invent new items; choose only from the given OPTIONS list.\n\nOutput format (STRICT):\n  \u2022 First output your hidden reasoning in <think>\u2026</think>.\n    \u2013 In your thinking, reference candidates by their numbers and names (or ids) to justify the choice.\n  \u2022 Then output ONLY the chosen option\u2019s NUMBER inside <answer>\u2026</answer>.\n    \u2013 Do NOT output the name, id, or any extra text\u2014ONLY the number.\n    \u2013 Do NOT include punctuation, quotes, or a period after the number.\n\nExamples of valid <answer>:\n  <answer>\n  3\n  </answer>\n\nExamples of INVALID <answer> (never do these):\n  <answer>3.</answer>                 \u2190 trailing period\n  <answer>\"3\"</answer>                \u2190 quoted\n  <answer>Option 3</answer>           \u2190 extra words\n  <answer>Parkland \u2026</answer>         \u2190 name instead of number\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nPROFILE:\n(no profile provided)\n\nSESSION CONTEXT:\n- Issue: minimum_wage\n- Issue detail: derived from video ct8CGJy9eF8\n- Issue source: tree_metadata\n- Session ID: vMi6mIAGtRTbH37HKK73\n- Step: 2\n- Slate source: session_log\n- Options in slate: 4\n\nCURRENT VIDEO:\nRaise The Minimum Wage -- Robert Reich & MoveOn.org \u2014 channel: MoveOn\n\nOPTIONS:\n1.

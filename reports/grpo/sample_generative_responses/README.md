# GRPO Sample Generative Model Responses

This gallery shows concrete questions given to the model and the
exact structured <think>/<answer> outputs it produced. Each example
adds explicit notes clarifying what the model did (selection or
opinion prediction), whether tags are present, and a short rationale
summarised from the <think> block.

Sections are grouped by issue and each includes up to 5 examples.

No examples found in existing predictions. Populate models/*/predictions.jsonl first.

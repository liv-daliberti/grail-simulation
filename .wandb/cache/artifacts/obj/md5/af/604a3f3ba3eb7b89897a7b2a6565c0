While not extremely liberal, they support wage increases but haven't stated they absolutely support these increases yet. Therefore, I believe the moderate supportive channel entitled \"Caller: Minimum Wage Should be set by Supply & Demand \u2014 channel: Thom Hartmann\" could be highly relevant according to their preferences, whereas some other opinions tend to emphasize their ideological leanings.
